### 2.2.1 构建分布式系统的复杂性

Because microservices are distributed and fine-grained \(small\), they introduce a level of complexity into your application that wouldn’t be there in more monolithic applications. Microservice architectures require a high degree of operational maturity. Don’t consider using microservices unless your organization is willing to invest in the automation and operational work \(monitoring, scaling\) that a highly distributed application needs to be successful.

由于微服务是分布式的并且粒度大小适合的（小粒度），所以它们也给你的应用带来了一定的复杂性，而这些复杂性在单体应用里是没有的。微服务架构要求具备高度的
