### 2.3.1 由搭建项目基本框架开始

To begin, you’ll create a skeleton project for the licensing. You can either pull down the source code down from GitHub \([https://github.com/carnellj/spmia-chapter2](https://github.com/carnellj/spmia-chapter2)\) or create a licensing-service project directory with the following directory structure:

* licensing-service
* src/main/java/com/thoughtmechanix/licenses
* controllers
* model
* services
* resources

Once you’ve pulled down or created this directory structure, begin by writing your Maven script for the project. This will be the pom.xml file located at the root of the project directory. The following listing shows the Maven POM file for your licensing service.
