### 1.4 为什么这本书适合你

If you’ve gotten this far into reading chapter 1, I suspect that

* You’re a Java developer.

* You have a background in Spring.

* You’re interested in learning how to build microservice-based applications.

* You’re interested in how to use microservices to build cloud-based applications.

* You want to know if Java and Spring are relevant technologies for building microservice-based applications.

* You’re interested in seeing what goes into deploying a microservice-based application to the cloud.

如果你读到了这里，那么我认为

* 你是个Java开发者。
* 你有使用Spring的背景。
* 你对学习如何构建基于微服务的应用感兴趣。
* 你对如何用微服务来构建基于云的应用感兴趣。
* 你想知道对于构建基于微服务的应用，Java和Spring是否是相关的技术。
* 你有兴趣了解如何将基于微服务的应用部署到云端。

I chose to write this book for two reasons. First, while I’ve seen many good books on the conceptual aspects of microservices, I couldn’t a find a good Java-based book on implementing microservices. While I’ve always considered myself a programming language polyglot \(someone who knows and speaks several languages\), Java is my core development language and Spring has been the development framework I “reach” for whenever I build a new application. When I first came across Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, I was blown away. Spring Boot and Spring Cloud greatly simplified my development life when it came to building microservice-based applications running in the cloud.

我选择写这本书是出于两个原因。第一点，虽然我已经看到了很多关于微服务概念方面的好书，但是我没有找到一本基于Java的关于实现微服务的好书。虽然我总是认为自己会多种编程语言，但Java是我的核心开发语言，而且每当我要构建一个新的应用时，Spring是我会用到的开发框架。在我第一次遇到Spring Boot和Spring Cloud时，我就感到难以置信。对于构建在云上运行并且基于微服务的应用，Spring Boot和Spring Cloud极大地简化了我的开发周期。

Second, as I’ve worked throughout my career as both an architect and engineer, I’ve found that many times the technology books that I purchase have tended to go to one of two extremes. They are either conceptual without concrete code examples, or are mechanical overviews of a particular framework or programming language. I wanted a book that would be a good bridge and middle ground between the architecture and engineering disciplines. As you read this book, I want to give you a solid introduction to the microservice patterns development and how they’re used in realworld application development, and then back these patterns up with practical and easy-to-understand code examples using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

第二点，在我作为架构师和工程师的整个工作生涯中，我常常发现我买的技术书籍走向了两个极端。他们要么只是讲了概念而没有具体的代码例子，要么就是对特定的框架或者编程语言做了个机械的概览。我想要这么一本书，它是架构和工程

Let’s shift gears for a moment and walk through building a simple microservice using Spring Boot.
