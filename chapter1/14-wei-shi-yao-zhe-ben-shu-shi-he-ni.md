### 1.4 为什么这本书适合你

If you’ve gotten this far into reading chapter 1, I suspect that

* You’re a Java developer.

* You have a background in Spring.

* You’re interested in learning how to build microservice-based applications.

* You’re interested in how to use microservices to build cloud-based applications.

* You want to know if Java and Spring are relevant technologies for building microservice-based applications.

* You’re interested in seeing what goes into deploying a microservice-based application to the cloud.

如果你读到了这里，那么我认为

* 你是个Java开发者。
* 你有使用Spring的背景。
* 你对学习如何构建基于微服务的应用感兴趣。
* 你对如何用微服务来构建基于云的应用感兴趣。
* 你想知道对于构建基于微服务的应用，Java和Spring是否是相关的技术。
* 你有兴趣了解如何将基于微服务的应用部署到云端。

I chose to write this book for two reasons. First, while I’ve seen many good books on the conceptual aspects of microservices, I couldn’t a find a good Java-based book on implementing microservices. While I’ve always considered myself a programming language polyglot \(someone who knows and speaks several languages\), Java is my core development language and Spring has been the development framework I “reach” for whenever I build a new application. When I first came across Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, I was blown away. Spring Boot and Spring Cloud greatly simplified my development life when it came to building microservice-based applications running in the cloud.

我选择写这本书是出于两个原因。首先，

Second, as I’ve worked throughout my career as both an architect and engineer, I’ve found that many times the technology books that I purchase have tended to go to one of two extremes. They are either conceptual without concrete code examples, or are mechanical overviews of a particular framework or programming language. I wanted a book that would be a good bridge and middle ground between the architecture and engineering disciplines. As you read this book, I want to give you a solid introduction to the microservice patterns development and how they’re used in realworld application development, and then back these patterns up with practical and easy-to-understand code examples using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

Let’s shift gears for a moment and walk through building a simple microservice using Spring Boot.
