### 1.7 究竟什么是云

The term “cloud” has become overused. Every software vendor has a cloud and everyone’s platform is cloud-enabled, but if you cut through the hype, three basic models exist in cloud-based computing. These are

* Infrastructure as a Service \(IaaS\)
* Platform as a Service \(PaaS\)
* Software as a Service \(SaaS\)

“云”这个词已经被滥用了。每个软件供应商都有一个云，每个供应商的平台都是支持云的，但如果你深入这些炒作的概念，你会发现，在基于云的计算中，有三种基本模型。它们分别是

* 基础架构即服务（Infrastructure as a Service，IaaS）
* 平台即服务（Platform as a Service，PaaS）
* 软件即服务（Software as a Service，SaaS）

To better understand these concepts, let’s map the everyday task of making a meal to the different models of cloud computing. When you want to eat a meal, you have four choices:

1. You can make the meal at home.
2. You can go to the grocery store and buy a meal pre-made that you heat up and serve.
3. You can get a meal delivered to your house.
4. You can get in the car and eat at restaurant.

为了更好地理解这几个概念，让我们来举个例子，这个例子将每天做饭这个任务与云计算的几个模型分别做了个对应。当你想吃顿饭时，你有四种选择：

1. 你可以在家里做饭。
2. 你可以去便利店里买一份提前做好了的饭菜，然后回家里加热来吃。
3. 你可以点一个外卖送到你家里。
4. 你可以开辆车去饭店里吃一顿。
