### 1.8 为什么是云和微服务

One of the core concepts of a microservice-based architecture is that each service is packaged and deployed as its own discrete and independent artifact. Service instances should be brought up quickly and each instance of the service should be indistin- guishable from another.

微服务架构的一个核心概念是，将每个服务打包并部署成独立的项目。服务实例应该是可以快速被增加的，而且服务实例之间互相独立。

As a developer writing a microservice, sooner or later you’re going to have to decide whether your service is going to be deployed to one of the following:

* Physical server—While you can build and deploy your microservices to a physical machine\(s\), few organizations do this because physical servers are constrained. You can’t quickly ramp up the capacity of a physical server and it can become extremely costly to scale your microservice horizontally across multiple physical servers.

* Virtual machine images—One of the key benefits of microservices is their ability to quickly start up and shut down microservice instances in response to scalability and service failure events. Virtual machines are the heart and soul of the major cloud providers. A microservice can be packaged up in a virtual machine image and multiple instances of the service can then be quickly deployed and started in either a IaaS private or public cloud.

* Virtual container—Virtual containers are a natural extension of deploying your microservices on a virtual machine image. Rather than deploying a service to a full virtual machine, many developers deploy their services as Docker containers \(or equivalent container technology\) to the cloud. Virtual containers run inside a virtual machine; using a virtual container, you can segregate a single virtual machine into a series of self-contained processes that share the same virtual machine image.

作为一个编写微服务的开发人员，迟早你都要决定你的服务部署在哪里，有下面几种选择：

* 物理服务器——虽然你可以在物理机上构建并部署微服务，但没有几个组织会这么做，因为物理机会有一些限制。你无法快速提高物理机的容量，而且如果你想在多台物理机上进行微服务横向扩展时，这种方式会变得极其昂贵。
* 虚拟机镜像——使用微服务的一大好处是，可以通过快速启动和关闭微服务实例来响应扩展性要求和服务失败事件。虚拟机是主流云提供商的核心和灵魂。一个微服务可以在一个虚拟机里进行打包，多个服务实例可以在IaaS私有或公有云里进行快速部署。
* 虚拟容器——虚拟容器是将微服务部署在虚拟机镜像上这种方式的一种很自然的扩展。许多开发者将他们的服务部署成Docker镜像（或者类似的容器技术）到云上，而不是将服务部署到一个完整的虚拟机上。多个虚拟容器在一台虚拟机上运行；通过使用虚拟容器，你可以将单台虚拟机分离成一系列自包含的进程，这些进程共享相同的虚拟机镜像。

The advantage of cloud-based microservices centers around the concept of elasticity. Cloud service providers allow you to quickly spin up new virtual machines and contain- ers in a matter of minutes. If your capacity needs for your services drop, you can spin down virtual servers without incurring any additional costs. Using a cloud provider to deploy your microservices gives you significantly more horizontal scalability \(adding more servers and service instances\) for your applications. Server elasticity also means that your applications can be more resilient. If one of your microservices is having prob- lems and is falling over, spinning up new service instances can you keep your applica- tion alive long enough for your development team to gracefully resolve the issue.

For this book, all the microservices and corresponding service infrastructure will be deployed to an IaaS-based cloud provider using Docker containers. This is a common deployment topology used for microservices:

* Simplified infrastructure management—IaaS cloud providers give you the ability to have the most control over your services. New services can be started and stopped with simple API calls. With an IaaS cloud solution, you only pay for the infrastructure that you use.

* Massive horizontal scalability—IaaS cloud providers allow you to quickly and succinctly start one or more instances of a service. This capability means you can quickly scale services and route around misbehaving or failing servers.

* High redundancy through geographic distribution—By necessity, IaaS providers have multiple data centers. By deploying your microservices using an IaaS cloud provider, you can gain a higher level of redundancy beyond using clusters in a data center.

> Earlier in the chapter we discussed three types of cloud platforms \(Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Services\). For this book, I’ve cho- sen to focus specifically on building microservices using an IaaS-based approach. While certain cloud providers will let you abstract away the deployment infrastructure for your microservice, I’ve chosen to remain vendor-independent and deploy all parts of my application \(including the servers\).

> For instance, Amazon, Cloud Foundry, and Heroku give you the ability to deploy your services without having to know about the underlying application container. They pro- vide a web interface and APIs to allow you to deploy your application as a WAR or JAR file. Setting up and tuning the application server and the corresponding Java con- tainer are abstracted away from you. While this is convenient, each cloud provider’s platform has different idiosyncrasies related to its individual PaaS solution.
>
> An IaaS approach, while more work, is portable across multiple cloud providers and allows us to reach a wider audience with our material. Personally, I’ve found that PaaS-based cloud solutions can allow you to quickly jump start your development effort, but once your application reaches enough microservices, you start to need the flexibility the IaaS style of cloud development provides.

> Earlier in the chapter, I mentioned new cloud computing platforms such as Function as a Service \(FaaS\) and Container as a Service \(CaaS\). If you’re not careful, FaaS- based platforms can lock your code into a cloud vendor platform because your code is deployed to a vendor-specific runtime engine. With a FaaS-based model, you might be writing your service using a general programming language \(Java, Python, JavaScript, and so on\), but you’re still tying yourself heavily to the underlying vendor APIs and runtime engine that your function will be deployed to.

The services built in this book are packaged as Docker containers. One of the reasons why I chose Docker is that as a container technology, Docker is deployable to all the major cloud providers. Later in chapter 10, I demonstrate how to package microser- vices using Docker and then deploy these containers to Amazon’s cloud platform.
