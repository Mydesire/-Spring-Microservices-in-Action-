### 1.1 什么是微服务

Before the concept of microservices evolved, most web-based applications were built using a monolithic architectural style. In a monolithic architecture, an application is delivered as a single deployable software artifact. All the UI\(user interface\), business, and database access logic are packaged together into a single application artifact and deployed to an application server.

在微服务概念形成之前，大多数web应用都是采用单体架构来构建的。在单体架构中，一个应用是作为一个可部署的软件来交付的。所有的UI（user interface，用户接口），业务和数据库访问逻辑都是包含在一个应用软件里并且部署在一个应用服务器上。

While an application might be a deployed as a single unit of work, most of the time there will be multiple development teams working on the application. Each development team will have their own discrete pieces of the application they’re responsible for and oftentimes specific customers they’re serving with their functional piece. For example, when I worked at a large financial services company, we had an in-house, custom-built customer relations management\(CRM\)application that involved the coordination of multiple teams including the UI, the customer master, the data warehouse, and the mutual funds team. Figure 1.1 illustrates the basic architecture of this application.

虽然一个应用可能是作为一个工作单元部署的，但大多数时候会有多个开发团队在合作开发这个应用。每个开发团队负责他们自己的模块，并且服务于他们负责的模块的用户。举个例子，在我之前工作过的一个大的金融服务公司里，我们曾经多团队合作开发过一个内部定制的CRM应用（customer relations management，用户关系管理）。这些团队包括UI团队，客户主团队，数仓团队以及互惠基金团队。图1.1说明了这个应用的基本体系结构。

The problem here is that as the size and complexity of the monolithic CRM application grew, the communication and coordination costs of the individual teams working on the application didn’t scale. Every time an individual team needed to make a change, the entire application had to be rebuilt, retested and redeployed.

这里的问题是，随着单体CRM应用的规模和复杂度的增长，团队间的交流和协调成本也随之增加。每次某个团队需要做出变动，整个应用就必须得重建，重测和重部署。![](/assets/屏幕快照 2018-04-02 21.51.00.png)**Figure1.1 **Monolithic applications force multiple development teams to artificially synchronize their delivery because their code needs to be built, tested, and deployed as an entire unit.

**图1.1 **单体应用强制要求不同开发团队人为地同步他们提交的代码，因为他们的代码必须作为一个整体来构建、测试和部署。

The concept of a microservice originally crept into the software development community’s consciousness around 2014 and was a direct response to many of the challenges of trying to scale both technically and organizationally large, monolithic applications. Remember, a microservice is a small, loosely coupled, distributed service. Microservices allow you to take a large application and decompose it into easy-to-manage components with narrowly defined responsibilities. Microservices help combat the traditional problems of complexity in a large code base by decomposing the large code base down into small, well-defined pieces. The key concept you need to embrace as you think about microservices is decomposing and unbundling the functionality of your applications so they’re completely independent of one another. If we take the CRM application we saw in figure 1.1 and decompose it into microservices, it might look like what’s shown in figure 1.2.

约在2014年，微服务概念引起了软件开发社区的关注，它直接反应了这些挑战：试图在技术和规模上大规模扩展应用。我们要记住，一个微服务是一个小的，松耦合的，分布式的服务。微服务允许我们将一个大型应用拆分成一个个易于管理并且严格定义好了指责的组件。微服务通过将大量代码拆解成定义良好的小块，从而帮助我们克服了大量代码复杂性的问题。对于微服务，我们必须要牢记的主要概念是，将我们的应用功能拆解，从而是它们不会相互依赖。如果我们将图1.1的CRM应用拆解成微服务，那它将变成如图1.2所示那样。
