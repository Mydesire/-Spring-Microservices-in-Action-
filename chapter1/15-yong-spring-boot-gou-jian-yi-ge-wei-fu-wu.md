### 1.5 用Spring Boot构建一个微服务

I’ve always had the opinion that a software development framework is well thoughtout and easy to use if it passes what I affectionately call the “Carnell Monkey Test.” If a monkey like me \(the author\) can figure out a framework in 10 minutes or less, it has promise. That’s how I felt the first time I wrote a sample Spring Boot service. I want you to have to the same experience and joy, so let’s take a minute to see how to write a simple “Hello World” REST-service using Spring Boot.

我总是持着这么一个观点：一个软件开发框架是经过仔细考虑的，而且如果它经过了卡内尔猴子测试（译者注：Carnell Monkey Test，作者对它的昵称）的话，那么它应该是易用的。如果一个首次接触的人可以在十分钟之内弄明白一个框架，那么它就保证了易用性这一点。我第一次写Spring Boot服务示例时就感受到了这点。我希望你也有相同感受和乐趣，所以我们花一分钟来看看如何用Spring Boot写一个简单的”Hello World”REST服务。

In this section, we’re not going to do a detailed walkthrough of much of the code

presented. Our goal is to give you a taste of writing a Spring Boot service. We’ll go into

much more detail in chapter 2.
