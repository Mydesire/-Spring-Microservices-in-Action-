### 1.10.8 Spring Cloud Security

Spring Cloud Security \(https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-security/\) is an authentication and authorization framework that can control who can access your services and what they can do with your services. Spring Cloud Security is token-based and allows services to communicate with one another through a token issued by an authentication server. Each service receiving a call can check the provided token in the HTTP call to validate the userâ€™s identity and their access rights with the service.

In addition, Spring Cloud Security supports the JavaScript Web Token \(https://jwt.io\). The JavaScript Web Token \(JWT\) framework standardizes the format of how a OAuth2 token is created and provides standards for digitally signing a created token.
