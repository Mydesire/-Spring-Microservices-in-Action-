### 1.10.1 Spring Boot

Spring Boot is the core technology used in our microservice implementation. Spring Boot greatly simplifies microservice development by simplifying the core tasks of building REST-based microservices. Spring Boot also greatly simplifies mapping HTTP-style verbs \(GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE\) to URLs and the serialization of the JSON protocol to and from Java objects, as well as the mapping of Java exceptions back to standard HTTP error codes.

Spring Boot是我们微服务实现里用到的核心技术。通过简化构建基于REST的微服务这个核心任务，Spring Boot使得微服务的研发变得很简单。Spring Boot也大幅简化了将HTTP风格的动词（GET，PUT，POST和DELETE）映射到URL的过程，将Java对象与JSON互序列化的过程，以及将Java异常映射成标准的HTTP错误码的过程。
