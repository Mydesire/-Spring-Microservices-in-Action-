### 1.6 为什么要改变我们构建应用的方式

We’re at an inflection point in history. Almost all aspects of modern society are now wired together via the internet. Companies that used to serve local markets are suddenly finding that they can reach out to a global customer base. However, with a larger global customer base also comes global competition. These competitive pressures mean the following forces are impacting the way developers have to think about building applications:

* _Complexity has gone way up_—Customers expect that all parts of an organization know who they are. “Siloed” applications that talk to a single database and don’t integrate with other applications are no longer the norm. Today’s applications need to talk to multiple services and databases residing not only inside a company’s data center, but also to external service providers over the internet.
* _Customers want faster delivery_—Customers no longer want to wait for the next annual release or version of a software package. Instead, they expect the features in a software product to be unbundled so that new functionality can be released quickly in weeks \(even days\) without having to wait for an entire product release.
* _Performance and scalability_—Global applications make it extremely difficult to predict how much transaction volume is going to be handled by an application and when that transaction volume is going to hit. Applications need to scale up across multiple servers quickly and then scale back down when the volume needs have passed.
* _Customers expect their applications to be available_—Because customers are one click away from a competitor, a company’s applications must be highly resilient. Failures or problems in one part of the application shouldn’t bring down the entire application.
