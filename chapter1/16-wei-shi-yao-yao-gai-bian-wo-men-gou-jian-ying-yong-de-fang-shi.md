### 1.6 为什么要改变我们构建应用的方式

We’re at an inflection point in history. Almost all aspects of modern society are now wired together via the internet. Companies that used to serve local markets are suddenly finding that they can reach out to a global customer base. However, with a larger global customer base also comes global competition. These competitive pressures mean the following forces are impacting the way developers have to think about building applications:

* _Complexity has gone way up_—Customers expect that all parts of an organization know who they are. “Siloed” applications that talk to a single database and don’t integrate with other applications are no longer the norm. Today’s applications need to talk to multiple services and databases residing not only inside a company’s data center, but also to external service providers over the internet.
* _Customers want faster delivery_—Customers no longer want to wait for the next annual release or version of a software package. Instead, they expect the features in a software product to be unbundled so that new functionality can be released quickly in weeks \(even days\) without having to wait for an entire product release.
* _Performance and scalability_—Global applications make it extremely difficult to predict how much transaction volume is going to be handled by an application and when that transaction volume is going to hit. Applications need to scale up across multiple servers quickly and then scale back down when the volume needs have passed.
* _Customers expect their applications to be available_—Because customers are one click away from a competitor, a company’s applications must be highly resilient. Failures or problems in one part of the application shouldn’t bring down the entire application.

我们正处于历史的拐点。现代社会的方方面面几乎都与互联网密不可分。原本只服务于当地市场的公司突然发现他们接触到全球的客户群。然而，在接触到全球客户群的同时，也带来了全球性的竞争。这些竞争压力意味着，开发者在考虑开发应用时受着以下几点影响：

* 复杂度正在上升——用户期望组织的每一个部分都知道他们是谁。只跟单一数据库交互并且不与其它应用整合的“孤立”应用不再常见。今时今日的应用需要与不同的服务和数据库进行交互，而且这些数据库不仅存在于某个公司的内部数据中心，而且还存在于互联网上的外部服务提供商。
* 用户想要更快的交付——用户不想再等待下一个年度发布或者软件包的版本。而是希望软件产品的特性不是被绑定的，这样，新的功能可以在短短的几周内（甚至几天）就可以被发布出来，而不用等整个产品发布。
* 性能和可扩展性——应用的全球化使我们很难去预测应用将要处理多少事务以及这些事务量什么时候出现。应用需要在多个不同服务器上进行快速扩展，然后在事务量降下去后进行规模回缩。
* 用户期望他们的应用是可用的——由于用户只需一个小小的鼠标点击就可以去到竞争对手那里去，所以一个公司的应用必须具有高度的弹性。应用局部出现问题不应该让整个应用都变得不可用。

To meet these expectations, we, as application developers, have to embrace the paradox that to build high-scalable and highly redundant applications we need to break our applications into small services that can be built and deployed independently of one another. If we “unbundle” our applications into small services and move them away from a single monolithic artifact, we can build systems that are

* _Flexible_—Decoupled services can be composed and rearranged to quickly deliver new functionality. The smaller the unit of code that one is working with, the less complicated it is to change the code and the less time it takes to test deploy the code.

* _Resilient_—Decoupled services mean an application is no longer a single “ball of mud” where a degradation in one part of the application causes the whole application to fail. Failures can be localized to a small part of the application and contained before the entire application experiences an outage. This also enables the applications to degrade gracefully in case of an unrecoverable error.

* _Scalable_—Decoupled services can easily be distributed horizontally across multiple servers, making it possible to scale the features/services appropriately. With a monolithic application where all the logic for the application is intertwined, the entire application needs to scale even if only a small part of the application is the bottleneck. Scaling on small services is localized and much more costeffective.

为了满足这些需求，我们作为应用开发者必须接受构建高扩展性和高度冗余应用的悖论，我们需要将应用分成一个个小的服务，这些服务可以各自独立于其它服务进行构建和部署。如果我们将应用分解成一组小的服务，并且将这些服务从一个单体里移除，我们构建出来的系统就会如下几个特性

* 灵活——解耦后的服务可以组合并重排，以达到快速交付新的功能的效果。

To this end, as we begin our discussion of microservices keep the following in mind:

_Small, Simple, and Decoupled Services = Scalable, Resilient, and Flexible Applications_
