### 1.10 使用Spring Cloud来构建微服务

In this section, I briefly introduce the Spring Cloud technologies that you’ll use as you build out your microservices. This is a high-level overview; when you use each technology in this book, I’ll teach you the details on each as needed.

Implementing all these patterns from scratch would be a tremendous amount of work. Fortunately for us, the Spring team has integrated a wide number of battletested open source projects into a Spring subproject collectively known as Spring Cloud. \([http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/\)\).

Spring Cloud wraps the work of open source companies such as Pivotal, HashiCorp, and Netflix in delivering patterns. Spring Cloud simplifies setting up and configuring of these projects into your Spring application so that you can focus on writing code, not getting buried in the details of configuring all the infrastructure that can go with building and deploying a microservice application.

Figure 1.14 maps the patterns listed in the previous section to the Spring Cloud projects that implement them.

Let’s walk through these technologies in greater detail.
