### 1.3 你将会在本书里学到的内容

This book is about building microservice-based applications using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud that can be deployed to a private cloud run by your company or a public cloud such as Amazon, Google, or Pivotal. With this book, we cover with hands-on examples

* What a microservice is and the design considerations that go into building a microservice-based application

* When you shouldn’t build a microservice-based application

* How to build microservices using the Spring Boot framework

* The core operational patterns that need to be in place to support microservice applications, particularly a cloud-based application

* How you can use Spring Cloud to implement these operational patterns

* How to take what you’ve learned and build a deployment pipeline that can be used to deploy your services to a private, internally managed cloud or a public cloud provider

本书将讨论如何通过使用Spring Boot和Spring Cloud来构建基于微服务的应用，这些应用能被部署到你公司的私有云或者公有云，如Amazon，Google，或者Pivotal。在本书里，我们将提供几个容易上手的示例

* 什么是微服务以及当要构建基于微服务的应用时的设计考虑点有哪些
* 什么时候你不应该构建基于微服务的应用
* 如何用Spring Boot框架来构建微服务
* 需要用来支持微服务应用的核心操作模式，尤其是基于云的应用
* 如果用Spring Cloud来实现这些操作模式
* 如何用你所学的
